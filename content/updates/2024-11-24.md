I just made a few changes to my website:

1. I am no longer using *Noto Serif* as my font, since it was blowing up my webpage size. I am now using *Helvetica*.
2. I switched out MathJax with KaTeX for speed and bundle size.

These efforts have reduced my website from 1.3MB to 344KB, a **73.5% size reduction!**

This means my website is under 512KB :))
