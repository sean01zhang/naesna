I was asked by a friend to create a button for my website. The only spec was that it had to be 88x31 pixels in dimension.

# Origin

Something about [GeoCitites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities). It seems like many websites had little 88x31 pixel images that were clickable.
- Here is an archive of some pixel images: [The 83x31 Archive](https://hellnet.work/8831/)
	- Be warned, this is not very SFW
# Purpose

Fun

# How

IDK. I ended up making it using paint.js. Then, I exported a few variations to get it animated. Finally, I took the collection of images and assembled it into a gif!

Here is mine:
