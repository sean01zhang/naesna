This playbook documents the schedule of actions that need to be taken to guarantee our food supply.

# Time Constraints

Ideally, you want 4 hours at room temperature between feeding and when the sourdough is going to be used (if doing 1:1:1).

Then, you will need 3 sets of stretch & folds, which are done at 1 hour intervals.

After the last stretch and fold, the dough will be shaped and put into the bread basket to proof overnight, refrigerated.

The next morning, you can bake the bread (around 1 hour).
Then the bread needs to cool for another hour.

Elapsed time from:
- **Feeding:** 18 hours
- **Mixing:** 14 hours
