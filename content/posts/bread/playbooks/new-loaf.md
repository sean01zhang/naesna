This playbook documents the process needed to create a sourdough from your starter in as much detail as possible.

## Prologue

- Make sure the sourdough starter is very active (it was fed recently)
	- If refrigerated, feed it a bit and leave it up to 2 hours in room temperature.

## Recipe

> Note: To try: maybe an autolyse to build more gluten to trap bubbles?
> Incorporate starter, then incorporate salt?
> 2% Salt? But higher salt content allows for more flexibility

- 600g bread flour into bowl
- 18g salt (3% of flour weight) into bowl
- 227g (1 cup) sourdough starter into bowl
- 397g of lukewarm water
- Mix well
- Bulk Fermentation:
	- Set dough in room temperature and wait for an hour
		- Modification: Set dough in oven for warmer environment. If there is a "proof" setting, this can be used.
		- Windowpane test: Dough should be stretchy enough allow you to create a windowpane
	- Stretch and fold, wait for an hour
		- You can use water to lubricate; Be gentle with the dough
	- Stretch and fold, wait for an hour
	- Stretch and fold;
	- (experimental addition) This may lead to bigger air pockets.
		- Bulk rise 3 hrs
		- 30 mins relax
- Transfer dough to floured mat, and shape by folding it in
	- Then also cup sides to get a round shape.
- Cold Fermentation
	- Once shaped, flour bread basket (with cloth or without, optional) with bread flour, or rice flour if available
	- Place dough *seam side up* into basket
	- Cover with a lid and place in fridge for 8 hours, but we can maximize for more.
- Once dough is ready
	- Place a tray at the bottom of the oven. This helps reduce intensity of heat on the bottom of the bread, leading to less browning.
	- Put dutch oven (lid off) into oven.
		- Lid can be put on during the preheat, but it is a bit easier to put the lid on afterwards (since you'll have to take it off when you put the bread in).
	- Preheat oven to 450 F.
- Once oven is preheated
	- Take sourdough out of fridge.
	- Score sourdough. Make sure to do enough such that it has room to expand.
	- Take dutch oven out
		- Sprinkle generous amounts of flour on the bottom
		- Put dough in.
	- Put dutch oven back in, wait for 35 mins @ 450 F
	- Lid off 20 mins @ 450 F
		- The oven I currently use runs a bit cooler, so I do 25 mins lid off.
- Once bread is baked, leave on cooling tray to cool, for approximately 1 hour.
