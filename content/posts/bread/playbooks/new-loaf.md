Reference Recipe: [King Arthur no knead](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/no-knead-sourdough-bread-recipe)

This playbook documents the process needed to create a sourdough from your starter in as much detail as possible.

## Prologue

- Make sure the sourdough starter is very active (it was fed recently)
	- If refrigerated, feed it a bit and leave it up to 2 hours in room temperature.

- 18g kosher salt (3% of flour weight) into bowl
- 227g (1 cup) sourdough starter into bowl
- 397g of lukewarm water
- Mix well, wait for an hour
- Stretch and fold, wait for an hour
- Stretch and fold, wait for an hour
- Stretch and fold;
- Line proofing basket with a generous amount of flour. Transfer dough into proofing basket.
- Resting: 5 hours room temp, or 8 hours in fridge.
	- If fridge: When you take the dough out, make sure it warms to room temperature for 2? hours before using it (Need to experiment).
	- ==(Experimental) Place dough on maybe a tray & put in oven to warm?==
- Once dough is ready
	- Place a tray at the bottom of the oven. Put dutch oven (with lid on) into oven.
	- Preheat oven to 450 F.
	- Shape dough into shape wanted.
- Once oven is preheated
	- Gently sprinkle flour on the sourdough.
	- Score sourdough. Make sure to do enough such that it has room to expand.
	- Take dutch oven out
		- Sprinkle flour on the bottom
		- Put dough in.
	- Put dutch oven back in, wait for 35 mins @ 450 F
	- Lid off 20 mins @ 450 F
- Once bread is baked, leave on cooling tray to cool, for approximately 1 hour.
## Notes

- The reference recipe calls for the dough to be shaped and put into the dutch oven while it is warming up.
	- This also means the dutch oven is NOT in the oven when preheating.
