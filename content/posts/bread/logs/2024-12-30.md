Bread making log, Dec 30. I made 2 loaves, so this will be two parts.

## Loaf 1

- Fed starter 1:1:1 at 10pm, left at RT
	- 200g ea
- Used starter around 11:30am
	- starter more than doubled, overfilled
- Mixed in water and dough first
- Then incorporated the starter
- Then added salt
- Poor mixture, it was quite lumpy
- did not pass windowpane test, dough was not airy
- Dough still sticky after last stretch and fold, shaped into a ball
- waited 10-15 mins
- Put into banneton
- Fridge overnight
- Preheat both dutch ovens no lid
- Put in oven 10:40am
- Did not take out to score until preheated
- did not shape, boule was firm and skin was dry
- A lot more expansion
- Expansion potentially caused crusting to not be as burned
	- This could also be conflated with 19 mins lid off
- Scoring went too far along the sides, reduce length of cross. Depth was slightly deep too.

## Loaf 2

- 1:1:1 on stbl starter
	- 120g
- Used starter around 7pm, last fed 10pm but in fridge. Taken out around 2/3pm (5 hour warm up)
- Mixed all together, started with 250g (1.5 cup) water ‚Äî added another 1/4 as needed
- did not pass windowpane test, was a bit dry
- Left in oven to proof on ‚Äúproof‚Äù setting
- Stretch and fold focused on not ripping the dough
- Much more stretchy than earlier one after stretch and fold.
- Put in oven 10:40am
- Did not take out to score until preheated
- did not shape, boule was firm and skin was dry
- A lot more expansion
- Expansion potentially caused crusting to not be as burned
	- This could also be conflated with 19 mins lid off
- Scoring went too far along the sides, reduce length of cross. Depth was slightly deep too.
