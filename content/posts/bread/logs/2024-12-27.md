Bread making log, Dec 27

- Starter successfully doubled in size 2 hours after feeding. 
- Required amt. in recipe called for about half
- Fed around 60g of flour and water (Resultant wt: 500g). Split into two jars, approximately 250g each. 
- Original in plastic container (nightly release), and new fork in glass jar (stable, weekly feeding)
- Plastic container will be placed in fridge due to production freeze lasting Sat - Sun (inclusive).
- Glass jar will be placed in fridge, to be fed around 1 January (6 days from now).
- Will attempt to not stretch too much to avoid breaking bubbles (in response to dough being a bit dense)
- Did not transfer to clean bowl after last stretch and fold
- Taken out 10 hours after resting
- shaped bread by stretching and folding a bit
- Placed into clean floured bowl and put in oven on ‚Äúproof‚Äù for 1:30, lid on
	- Dough was more bubbly than last time
	- Dough stuck to walls of the bowl, added flour to compensate
- Bake time good, think I needed more scoring
	- AI: Make sure scores are long so they can expand
- Seasoned dutch oven with olive oil; Very smoky after preheat.
	- AI: After preheat, make sure to take dutch oven lid off under range hood. Also, **olive oil is not low smoke point**.
- Puffier after baked
