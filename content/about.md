# About Me

I am a 4th year Computer Science student at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca).

I use my website to document things I've been thinking about or have been doing, mainly for the benefit of myself in the future.

Here is my contact information.

## 88x31

A small pool of buttons (specifically 88px in width and 31px in height) that link to friends, in alphabetical order.

## Web Rings

My newbie take on what a web ring is, since I was not alive at it's peak of popularity -- 
Neighborhoods of websites that share a common interest, primarily popular before search engines (and later, social media) became the portal to the internet. More recently revived for the sake of nostalgia.
